		<h1 class="post-h1">DAY 05</h1>

		<h2>I'm a cheating cheater.</h2>

		<p class = "post">Temptation abounds for the teetotaler during celebrations. I knew that this project would test my willpower, but I didn&rsquo;t envision a breakdown happening in the first week.</p>

		<p class = "post">I planned to eat my first cheat meal on Saturday. I&rsquo;ve been craving a good, old-fashioned, American cheeseburger. Then I read an <a href="http://native.is/food/fat-mos/">article</a> on <a href="http://fatmos.com">Fat Mo</a>&rsquo;s in the July issue of <a href="http://native.is">NATIVE</a> and started daydreaming about what writer Matt Colangelo calls:</p>

		<blockquote>&ldquo;A burger from a faraway place and a bygone era.&rdquo;</blockquote>

		<p class = "post">What a line! Without even describing the meat, or the bun, or the spices, or condiments, he&rsquo;s got me salivating.</p>

		<p class = "post">Then the Independence Day celebrations came into full swing. We played bocce ball on the lawn, cracked open beer and wine, the smell of grilled meat &amp; firework dust wafted over the fence. Usually I&rsquo;m the first to partake when there is alcohol, especially on holidays. So without participating in the merriment, I definitely felt a touch of anxiety.</p>

		<p class = "post">Even with a heritage of addictive personalities, I doubt Soylent will be my new addiction. During the festivities I became occupied more with the buffet of home-cooked meals spread through the kitchen.</p>

		<p class="post">I caved almost immediately. I piled brisket onto my plate. Next came squash casserole, tomatoes, and cucumber. Then braised turnip greens and black eyed peas. I noticed a simple salad of arugula, nuts, cheese, and cherries; I piled that on top of an already full plate.</p>

		<div class="centered"><img src="images/cheatmeal1.jpg" class="inline-photo"></div>

		<p class = "post">My first bite was a pickled cherry, made over the last week by one of the party guests. </p>

		<blockquote>Tasting the small, sweet fruit was like defibrillating my tastebuds.</blockquote>

		<p class="post">The fleshy texture felt like a dose of reality. My eyes widened and I took a swig of white wine. Food was back in my life &mdash; if only for a brief meal.</p>

		<p class="post">I hadn&rsquo;t realized that Soylent flatlined my senses. The utilitarian powder is inherently devoid of emotion. The effect is somewhat hypnotic. Food becomes sustenance. Life becomes existence. I felt awakened during the short few minutes at the table.</p>

		<p class="post">Hours slept: 9.5</p>

		<p class="post">Meal times:<br>1:00PM : 16oz<br>4:00PM : 16oz<br>6:00PM : 12oz<br>8:30PM : Cheat meal #1</p>

		<p class="post">Weigh-in : 169.5lbs<br>Weigh-out: 170lbs</p>
