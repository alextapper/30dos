		<h2>Challenges.</h2>

		<p class = "post">I think I shot myself in the foot by cheating a second time this weekend. Not that I haven’t missed food during the previous 2 weeks. I have. Many times. But during my Saturday dinner in previous weeks, I gorged on so much heavy food that I was too full to even have my breakfast dose the next day.</p>

		<blockquote>Eating Soylent actually felt good. Like a simple, bland, cleansing shake.</blockquote>

		<p class = "post">Soylent has this aura about it. Some combination of the media attention, the slick packaging, the fact that I can survive entirely on a powder mixed with water… Even if I didn’t know the ingredients or what it tasted like, Soylent still <em>feels</em> heathy. </p>

		<p class = "post">It wasn’t just having a double dose of solid food so quickly, it was more about the culture and community surrounding the meal: seeing friends who I hadn’t seen in weeks or months, sharing homemade food, catching up over stories. What I really miss are these social aspects that are baked into the experience of food.</p>

		<blockquote>Soylent seemingly circumvents this part of society.</blockquote>

		<p class = "post">Yes I’ve shared my experiences with the stuff on this website. I’ve even shared samples of the actual product with curious friends. But I can’t help feeling like an anti-social schlub when friends go out for dinner or drinks and I’d rather stay home and be productive (and drink my shake).</p>

		<p class = "post">But there’s something about the Soylent lifestyle that leads to an unhealthy desire for efficiency. I see more of the waste inherent in our society — in places where I never before thought to look. Wasted words in communication. Wasted energy in fighting losing battles. Wasted thoughts on things (or people) that won’t change.</p>

		<blockquote>If nothing else, challenging the food industry status quo helps me look critically upon other areas of my life and analyze them too.</blockquote>
