		<h1 class="post-h1">DAY 19</h1>

		<h2>New Old Experiences.</h2>

		<p class = "post">On cheat meal days, I always wake up with a smile. I feel like a dolphin being released from SeaWorld back into the wild. There’s a whole ocean of possibility! </p>

		<p class = "post">Today I took a bit of a gamble and tried a new restaurant, Korea House on Charlotte Pike, and a new dish, Dolsot Bibimbap. It’s rice served in a hot stone pot, with vegetables, beef, a little spice, and (my favorite) a fried egg on top.</p>

		<div class="centered"><img src="images/bibimbap.jpeg" class="inline-photo"></div>

		<blockquote>Basically a flavor explosion.</blockquote>

		<p class = "post">My sense of taste is slightly heightened during these escapes. I feel every texture and more readily identify the different ingredients. I appreciate it more too, relish in every bite instead of my usual frenetic pace of consumption.</p>

		<p class = "post">More than that sensory stimulation, sharing food with friends feels like a return to society, a return to culture. Soylent has made me feel kind of lonely, a little left out. Kind of like the little brother left behind on lookout while the other kids sneak over the curmudgeonly neighbor’s fence to get their foul baseball.</p>

		<p class = "post">I find myself earnestly asking friends during the week about their meals. Sometimes daydreaming about what my next one will be.</p>

		<blockquote>Soylent circumvents the shared cultural experience of mealtime.</blockquote>

		<p class = "post">Dating, for instance, would be terrible in a Soylent-only society. There aren’t many events or gatherings that don’t involve food — at least none that I’d want to go to!</p>

		<p class="post">Hours slept: 9</p>

		<p class="post">Meal times:<br>9:00AM : 12oz<br>1:00PM : 16oz<br>5:00PM : Cheat meal #3 Dolsot Bibimbap!<br>9:00PM : 10oz</p>

		<p class="post">Weigh-in : 168lbs<br>Weigh-out: 171.5lbs (I ate a lot of that bibimbap...)</p>
