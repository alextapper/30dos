		<h2>Loathe the Loaf.</h2>

		<p class = "post">In an attempt to encourage this project, a friend sent me an <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/thesalt/2014/01/02/256605441/punishing-inmates-with-the-loaf-persists-in-the-u-s">NPR exposé</a> on a practice in American prisons that borders on cruel and unusual. When inmates misbehave in certain penitentiaries, their punishment is something called &ldquo;the loaf.&rdquo; There are regional varieties of the loaf, or &ldquo;Nutraloaf,&rdquo; but it&rsquo;s generally a meatloaf (of sorts) made from blending up different combinations of vegetables, beans, starches, and occasionally meat.</p>

		<blockquote>Basically they are forced to eat the same, cardboard-flavored glob for countless meals on end.</blockquote>

		<p class = "post">According to Corrections Officers, it works well as a deterrent for misbehavior. Even inmates with life-sentences and nothing to lose, avoid the loaf at all costs.</p>

		<p class = "post">Yes, it contains the necessary nutrients to sustain life, but prisoners sometimes refuse to eat it until they become dizzy or malnourished. Numerous cases calling the practice &ldquo;cruel and unusual&rdquo; have been brought before the Supreme Court, seeking to determine the constitutionality of using food as punishment.</p>

		<p class = "post">For some reason, I can&rsquo;t help but think about my dog&rsquo;s diet. Besides the occasional treat or bone, he eats the same food every day. While his evolutionary biology probably does not include the craving for a varied diet (like us humans ostensibly do), I can’t help but wonder if he thinks, on some level:</p>

		<blockquote>&ldquo;Damnit, not kibble again!&rdquo;</blockquote>

		<p class = "post">In some ways, Ramsay is my prisoner. His actions and freedoms are limited to those I permit. He certainly knows when he&rsquo;s misbehaved. But his diet is <em>designed</em> to promote canine well-being. It has bison and vegetables in it!</p>

		<p class = "post">In fact, I’ve found his uniform diet to be healthier. An abrupt change in his food causes irregularities. And no one like having irregularities.</p>

		<p class="post">On some level, I relate to both the prisoners and to my dog. I&rsquo;m trapped by the design of my own project, and must consume a (relatively) bland food for 30 days. I&rsquo;m also trapped by the design of Soylent&rsquo;s manufacturers to consuming only the nutrients provided in each packet.</p>

		<p class = "post">But Soylent is designed to promote my well-being, according to its creators. However, after only 3 days, I’ve found a mixture of dread and eager anticipation for each meal.</p>

		<blockquote>So then, are there moralities inherent in diets?</blockquote>

		<p class = "post">Some religions prescribe specific dietary restrictions. Some people keep a vegetarian or vegan diet, whether for religious, health, moral, or personal reasons. Some people do juice cleanses or self-experiment with trendy diets to lose weight and expel toxins.</p>

		<p class = "post">Do the intentions or the effects determine the morality of a diet?</p>
