		<h1 class="post-h1">DAY 18</h1>

		<h2>(R)evolutionary.</h2>

		<p class = "post">Today&rsquo;s batch was the first one I made the night before. At first glance this morning, I was worried about the small layer of separation (the oil floated to the top), but a few quick shakes and it was back to normal.</p>

		<p class = "post">Then I took my first sip and something was different. As the pitcher sat overnight in the fridge, something magical happened.</p>

		<blockquote>Almost all of the grit vanished. </blockquote>

		<p class = "post">Thinking about it now makes sense, but it never crossed my mind. I guess the powder dissolves more completely over time. It was also cold and ready to drink — whereas, I usually need to add ice in the morning. I&rsquo;ll be doing this from now on.</p>

		<blockquote>I also added some cinnamon to the mix.</blockquote>

		<p class = "post">I had planned to do this earlier, but it slipped my mind. Cinnamon makes the whole batch much more palatable. Plus it&rsquo;s good for you too.</p>

		<p class = "post">These two changes made the experience of eating Soylent much better. But I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s just better in comparison to the previous 17 days. If you sat the two glass side-by-side, you’d be able to tell the difference. But if I started out doing it this way, I&rsquo;d probably still be sick of it at this point.</p>

		<blockquote>So really, it&rsquo;s just an <em>evo</em>lutionary step, not a <em>revo</em>lutionary one. </blockquote>

		<p class = "post">My quality of life increase only a minor amount compared to yesterday.</p>

		<p class = "post">I think that&rsquo;s representative of my whole experience with Soylent. The creators tout Soylent as a revolutionary change in food science, but you could already go to a local grocery store and buy any number of meal replacement powders and drinks. Maybe they aren&rsquo;t as cheap or nutrient-dense as Soylent.</p>

		<blockquote>If Soylent is any better, it&rsquo;s only by evolution, not revolution.</blockquote>

		<p class = "post">Perhaps one day, though...</p>

		<p class="post">Hours slept: 7</p>
