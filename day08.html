		<h2>A Closer Look at the Label.</h2>

		<p class = "post">Rosa Labs markets Soylent as a &ldquo;total food replacement powder,&rdquo; with the intention of replacing food altogether. Their website’s <a href="http://www.soylent.me/#about">about page</a> states:</p>

		<blockquote>&ldquo;Soylent is a food product designed for use as a staple meal by all adults. Each serving of Soylent provides maximum nutrition with minimum effort.”</blockquote>

		<p class = "post">The expression &ldquo;staple meal&rdquo; interests me here. Many cultures around the world have their own staple meal or crop. Varieties of corn, rice, and potatoes are commonly-consumed items. According to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staple_food">Wikipedia</a>, maize (corn) is the most produced staple food in the world.</p>

		<blockquote>But how does the nutrient content of Soylent compare against a diet of traditional food?</blockquote>

		<p class = "post">How about against the Percentage Daily Values of a standard 2000 calorie diet?</p>

		<p class = "post">Well, it&rsquo;s quite confusing to determine because of unclear Nutrition Facts labeling (surprise!). Each daily amount of Soylent is shipped in two parts: a <strong>444g bag</strong> labeled &ldquo;Soylent Powder&rdquo; and a <strong>2oz bottle</strong> labeled &ldquo;Oil Blend.&rdquo; The oil blend contains Canola Oil and Fish Oil (along with much of the fat &amp; cholesterol content), and is separated for those with vegan/vegetarian dietary preferences.</p>

		<div class="centered"><img src="images/label.jpeg" class="inline-photo"></div>

		<p class = "post">The data on the nutrition label is split between two columns. I supposed their intention is to provide accurate and separate information for all customers. Fair enough. But from the picture above, could you tell me how many grams of fat are in the whole bottle of the oil blend? Could you do it without a calculator? (I couldn&rsquo;t.)</p>

		<blockquote>For fun, let&rsquo;s compare some of the nutritional content of Soylent to an equal amount of maize.</blockquote>

		<p class = "post">From what I can tell, 144g of Soylent contains ~100% of the daily value (based on a 2000 calorie diet) for each of the following: calories, total fat, potassium, total carbohydrates, dietary fiber, Vitamins A, C, D, E, K, B6, B12, metals like zinc, copper, iron, magnesium, calcium, biotin… etc. The only outliers are protein (114g — personal daily % requirement varies depending on bodyweight, or isn’t required by the FDA), cholesterol (15%), and sodium (45%).</p>

		<p class = "post">Google tells me that 144g of corn contains:<br>26% of your daily calories<br>10% of total fat<br>2% of sodium<br>12% of potassium<br>35% of total carbohydrates<br>40% of dietary fiber<br>13g of protein<br>22% of iron<br>44% of B6, magnesium<br>6% Vitamin A<br>0% Vitamin C, D, calcium</p>

		<blockquote>Does this make Soylent the staple of the future?</blockquote>

		<p class = "post">A manufactured crop specifically designed to support human life at all levels? (Its beige color is reminiscent of the skin color of a mixed-race humanity somewhere in the distant future.) Does this make it more akin to genetically modified foods, which are designed to be bigger, fleshier, seedless, and more nutritious?</p>
