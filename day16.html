		<h2>Why Is Simple So Damn Hard?</h2>

		<p class = "post">I&rsquo;m a design nerd and an immediate fanboy of anything simple and experience-oriented. From single-feature software to intelligent kitchen utensils made from cutting edge materials, well-designed items that last a lifetime are simply delightful to use.</p>

		<blockquote>A product is great when I use it and feel like the designer spied on me during intimate moments of struggle with inferior competition.</blockquote>

		<p class = "post">In many ways, this month-long project has been a pursuit of the ultimate simplicity in diet design. Not a diet designed to lose weight or build muscle or with any particular body metric in mind.</p>

		<p class = "post">The goal was simplicity. I guess I&rsquo;ve somewhat achieved that. I&rsquo;ve survived the last two weeks by consuming only a beige powder mixed with water. Meal preparation is dead simple. Cleanup is even easier when compared to scrubbing pots and pans.</p>

		<blockquote>Unfortunately, simplicity is only half the battle.</blockquote>

		<p class = "post">Without a keen attention to each detail in the experience, a product falls short of greatness. For Soylent, the experience is in every sip and how each sip makes you feel.</p>

		<p class = "post">I shake my batch each morning by hand in a large pitcher. The mixture fills about halfway so there&rsquo;s plenty of surface area to help it dissolve. Yet each sip is still grainy. I can feel grit in my teeth after a &ldquo;meal&rdquo; and I&rsquo;m compelled to use mouthwash to rinse it out. Sometimes that texture sticks in the back of my throat too, needing a mug of coffee or water to rinse it down.</p>

		<blockquote>And the moments in between meals can be frustrating.</blockquote>

		<p class = "post">Aside from some idiosyncrasies, my stomach has mostly adjusted to the diet. I&rsquo;ve been regular, if slightly less frequent than usual. I&rsquo;ve still been gassy. And I canâ€™t help but wonder what is causing an acrid, chemical smell to my waste.</p>

		<p class = "post">Arguably, this experience isn&rsquo;t that much different from eating a sloppy meal. Ribs and corn on the cob get stuck between my teeth and need a toothpick. And after a BBQ binge, I want nothing more than to slip into a food coma on the couch for hours. Too much beer or greasy food back me feel gassy and bloated (and makes for an unpleasant morning ritual too).</p>

		<p class = "post">So what&rsquo;s the difference in the experience? I guess it comes down to taste, texture, and variety versus convenience. Are those variables worth enough to give up in favor of an less complex experience? I guess that boils down to personal preference.</p>

		<blockquote>I just hope that Soylent&rsquo;s creators spy on these moments and learn how to make the experience a great one.</blockquote>
