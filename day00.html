		<h2>In which I preview my perception of things to come.</h2>

		<blockquote>I’ll be the first to admit that this whole project is quite abnormal.</blockquote>

		<p class = "post">I’m sure that the idea of replacing a &ldquo;traditional food&rdquo; diet with a mysterious nutrient-replacement powder disgusts many, if not all, of you. Conversations with friends and family reveal a polarized split between support and criticism.</p>

		<p class = "post">My surgeon father said it “looks gross” and bet $100 that I don’t last two weeks (easy money, thanks PoppaDoc). My art-school sister was curious about the color and consistency of Soylent-only poops (don’t worry Katie, I’ll keep you updated!). My cross-fit <span class = "strikeout">addicted</span> committed roommate (and former rugby teammate) matched my order for a month’s supply faster than I could say &ldquo;burpee.&rdquo; The only lukewarm reply came as three simple words via email from exhibitionist viral-youtuber <a href="http://www.caseyneistat.com">Casey Neistat</a>: &ldquo;good luck alex.&rdquo;</p>

		<blockquote>To be honest, I’ve built up a lot of internal anticipation regarding this project.</blockquote>

		<p class = "post">I placed my order for Soylent over 12 months ago. In that time, I’ve talked it up to friends, family, and anyone else who will put up with my quasi-radical rants.</p>

		<p class = "post">During these conversations, I feel like my motives are generally misunderstood. Most simply, this project is an entertaining combination of a few areas of personal interest. Technology, food, writing, sharing, testing myself&hellip; all wrapped up in a web platform that I designed from scratch. </p>

		<blockquote>On the pure utilitarian level, food consumes a healthy portion of my two most valuable resources: <em>time &amp; money</em>.</blockquote>

		<p class = "post">Between grocery shopping, cooking, cleaning, chewing, driving, dining out, getting drinks, deciding, waiting, and digesting, food has a high monetary cost and, arguably an even higher opportunity cost. And the more fine fare I enjoy, the more often I desire it.</p>

		<p class = "post">However, a good meal provides me with more pleasure than almost anything else per dollar and minute spent.</p>

		<p class = "post">My expectations are influenced by the “reviews” I’ve read by early testers and the experiences of creator Rob Rhinehart, who’s been quoted eating 90% Soylent meals for the past 18 months. I expect to lose weight &mdash; or maybe just trim down a few body fat percentage points &mdash; due to caloric restriction. I expect my hunger to be unfulfilled at the tail-end of meal blocks. I expect to be envious of friends going out for drinks and dinner. I expect craving munchies in the cupboard and long looks at beer in the fridge in the evenings.</p>

		<p class = "post">I also expect to enjoy the free time gained by <em>not</em> planning, shopping, prepping, cooking, eating, cleaning, and thinking about food. Perhaps a change of habit on the same level as a Tesla owner eluding gas stations. I expect to be awkward at social engagements that revolve around food and drink. I expect to seek out other social opportunities that don’t revolve around food. I expect to have more than one awkward conversation explaining the project. I expect to practice letting go.</p>

		<blockquote>Most of all, I expect to learn more about myself and enjoy the process of doing so.</blockquote>
