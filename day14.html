		<h2>Soylent Soda.</h2>

		<p class = "post">Mondays. A clean slate. A new checklist. Well, maybe you have a couple of to-do&rsquo;s leftover from last week. I did. But they&rsquo;re small. No biggie.</p>

		<p class = "post">In any case, I like to use Mondays as a minor refresh for my life. A chance to start good habits and and get work done. Plus I get a nice feeling of accomplishment by rolling up my sleeves and tackling my hardest problem first. It sets my week up to be a productive one.</p>

		<p class = "post">So naturally, this feeling of immense accomplishment needs proper rewarding. Tonight, I decided to treat myself with frothy, bubbly homemade concoction: Soylent Soda.</p>

		<div class="centered"><img src="images/soda.jpg" class="inline-photo"></div>

		<blockquote>Really, it&rsquo;s just a combination of Soylent and Perrier.</blockquote>

		<p class = "post">The motivational power of food amazes me. Positive reinforcement &amp; treats were the key to training my dog Ramsay (though he still hasn&rsquo;t quite figured out fetch). Kids will do almost anything for pizza and ice cream. Heck, in college I trained <em>myself</em> to complete writing assignments by eating a portion of a snack after competing each page.</p>

		<p class = "post">On Jerry Seinfeld&rsquo;s brilliantly mundane internet show, <a href="http://comediansincarsgettingcoffee.com/">Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee</a>, Tina Fey even admits that &ldquo;the only reward for anything, is food.&rdquo; As if winning an Emmy isn&rsquo;t reward enough, she goes home and rewards herself with something she&rsquo;s not supposed to eat.</p>

		<p class = "post">With Tina, it&rsquo;s hard to tell exactly how sarcastic she&rsquo;s being, but I really want to believe she got home after the award show, put the Emmy on the kitchen counter, dove into the junk drawer and said, to herself:</p>

		<blockquote>&ldquo;Good job today Tina, now you can have this Butterfinger!&rdquo;</blockquote>

		<p class = "post">Though food is ultimately sustenance, it also seems to unlock a carnal joy inside us. It&rsquo;s easy to draw the line between decadent dishes that are sensory-driven and food for nutrition&rsquo;s sake (though thereâ€™s certainly overlap), but is there a point to which pleasure is enhanced due to sensory depravation?</p>

		<p class = "post">I&rsquo;ve certainly experienced intense flavor &amp; enjoyment in my two cheat meals. Can that be attributed to the bland diet my tastebuds have become accustomed to? Yes, they were truly exceptional meals, well-prepared &amp; homemade. But would I have enjoyed them less if they didn&rsquo;t stand out as much?</p>

		<blockquote>Sometimes the reward is really that: something to be regarded as worthy &amp; excellent &amp; out of the ordinary.</blockquote>
