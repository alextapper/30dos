		<h2>Work in Progress</h2>

		<p class = "post">Apologies for the radio silence, my dear. This project took a backseat to others. Despite the special place 30DoS occupies in my heart, I became bored with the monotony of the Soylent lifestyle long before the 30 days ended.</p>

		<blockquote>So I quit. I gave up. Threw in the towel.</blockquote>

		<p class = "post">I could rely on excuses for the hasty ending: &ldquo;Traveling with Soylent is difficult, I&rsquo;m cranky from too few calories, I&rsquo;m busy with <em>real</em> work…&rdquo; But none of those matter. Plus I loathe excuses.</p>

		<p class = "post">Usually, I rely on setting low expectations for experiences as a way to temper anticipation and manufacture pleasant surprises &mdash; Hollywood movies, in particular, come to mind. However, I reversed my usual course with 30 Days of Soylent. I hyped it up with friends and family. I got my roommate to order Soylent. I built a custom-freaking-website to record my ramblings. Perhaps it was because of this hype, not <em>despite</em> of it, that I failed to complete the project.</p>

		<blockquote>So, why did I deviate from my typical &ldquo;under promise, over deliver&rdquo; Jedi mind-trick?</blockquote>

		<p class = "post">Looking back, I can&rsquo;t pinpoint one reason. In my eyes, Soylent had revolutionary potential. Not in the sense that it would solve world hunger (though if I were running the Rosa Labs, I would focus on contributing to that issue), but revolutionary in a personal habit-changing way. I wanted to assimilate Soylent into my lifestyle to save money and increase productivity. I’m kind of a process-optimization nerd.</p>

		<p class = "post">Humans are creatures of habit, more so than we think. This is not a bad thing. I find great importance, laser productivity, and automatic creativity with a steady routine. Being able to take carve out daily rituals &mdash; prayer, painting, coffee &mdash; helps mesmerize us into productive and creative trances.</p>

		<blockquote>My mistake: I attempted to force Soylent into that ritual category.</blockquote>

		<p class = "post">Like walking the dog or meditation, preparing and eating Soylent became a daily practice. The goal? Limit a few variables to discover more about myself &amp; unleash another wellspring of creative productivity through aestheticism. But these moments of ritual take different shapes for different people. We are individuals. No singular practice is perfect for every person. I&rsquo;ve certainly tried dozens: yoga, meditation, pour-over coffee, prayer, reading, napping, insomnia, drawing, walking, loose tea… Perhaps it was foolish to lump Soylent into this category.</p>

		<p class = "post">I&rsquo;m not sure whether to call this project a failure or not. Honestly, I don&rsquo;t think it particularly matters. There are no shortcuts in the process of self-discovery. No magic formulas or secret sauces. I&rsquo;ve heard that it takes 21 days to form a habit, however I crumbled after day 23. Either way, the proof &mdash; and the peace &mdash; comes with process.</p>
