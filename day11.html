		<h2>Party &amp; Soylent (and Party &amp; Soylent)</h2>

		<p class = "post">I like going to places and events alone. Exploring a space is as much a personal discovery as a geographic one. However, in a big, small town like Nashville, it&rsquo;s hard to go places and not know people.</p>

		<p class = "post">Sometimes I think of myself as a xenophilic introvert. I enjoy the energy of meeting new people, I can be just as happy at home with my dog and a book. But the more I get out there, the more I discover that each of us conceal hidden talents &mdash; sometimes even from ourselves &mdash; and the only way to draw out these gifts and ideas is through collaboration and interpersonal connection.</p>

		<blockquote>How does this relate to Soylent?</blockquote>

		<p class = "post">Well, first of all, it can be an interesting conversation starter. But more than that, it forces me to start them. No more going right up to the bar for a tall frosty one. That&rsquo;s a crutch. It puts the onus on me to be entertaining or to otherwise draw entertainment from the group. </p>

		<p class = "post">Life is long.<br>Live slowly.<br>Intention is important.<br>Conversation matters.</p>

		<p class = "post">This project has reinforced these thoughts for me. Some days it feels like I have an eternity of beige powder left to choke down. Others, its consumption becomes automatic like breathing and I focus on the rest of life.</p>		

		<blockquote>You can still party &amp; Soylent.</blockquote>
