		<h2>Is this... healthy?</h2>

		<p class = "post">Getting out of bed today was painful. Yes, I did a small workout last night. Yes, it was the first real exercise I’ve done in more than a few weeks. Yes, I have the occasional multi-snooze morning. Somehow this felt different.</p>

		<blockquote>Maybe it’s just a dose of self-imposed psychology. My own experiment playing cruel mental tricks on me.</blockquote>

		<p class = "post">But how can I not feel some resistance? Whether real or imagined, healthy or detrimental, my body is transitioning from a whole-food diet to a Soylent-only diet. There will be some effects. Maybe this is just a minor shockwave of adjustment.</p>

		<p class = "post">I consulted with my friend <a href="http://anderwilson.com">Ander Wilson</a>, a nutrition professor. Her immediate reaction to the project was one of concern.</p>

		<blockquote>“Why would you put your body through that?”</blockquote>

		<p class = "post">She explained something that I never considered: my digestive tract is actually a muscle, and like every other muscle in my body, it will atrophy without exercise. &ldquo;It needs bulk,&rdquo; were her exact words.</p>

		<p class = "post">I&rsquo;m not sure what the side-effects of an atrophied digestive tract are, and quite honestly, I’m too afraid to Google them. She also mentioned increase risk of colon cancer due to a similar lack of &ldquo;normalcy,&rdquo; and a word of warning about how my body might react to the weekly cheat meals.</p>

		<p class = "post">My surgeon father had similar reactions, mentioning conditions like lipolysis, ketosis, and other jargon I didn&rsquo;t want to look up for fear of a bout of WebMD-induced hypochondria.</p>

		<p class="post">It’s not that I think I&rsquo;m immune to serious medical conditions. I could be horribly wrong, but I think that 30 days is too short for this lifestyle change to take major effect &mdash; positive or negative &mdash; on my health.</p>

		<blockquote>I dislike the subjectivity of the word &ldquo;healthy.&rdquo;</blockquote>

		<p class = "post">But I like to think that I live a healthy lifestyle. I try to maintain good eating and exercise habits. During a typical week, I estimate cooking 14+ meals &mdash; mostly recipes inspired by Tim Ferriss&rsquo;s &ldquo;food as fuel&rdquo; mentality from his book <em>The Four Hour Body</em>. I also have a penchant for <a href="http://thugkitchen.com/">Thug Kitchen</a>&rsquo;s vegan recipes.</p>

		<p class = "post">I exercise regularly, though admittedly to a minimum level of intensity. I use the stairs instead of the elevator and enjoy <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a41qdUZq2c8">bike rides with my lab-mix</a> (he pulls me so this doesn’t really count).</p>

		<p class = "post">Will this project derail my health? Or will my body adjust to Rob&rsquo;s proposed diet of the future? I do admit to feeling a little out-of-sorts today, but I’m going to attribute that to the transition.</p>
