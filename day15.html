		<h2>On the Go.</h2>

		<p class = "post">Going into this project, I really thought that Soylent would be the perfect drink for an active lifestyle. I imagined it being a great solution for camping out at Bonnaroo for days without a fridge or stove. Or for long days out on the lake. Or even days when I can&rsquo;t find time to stop for lunch.</p>

		<p class = "post">I immediately thought of a particular globetrotting filmmaker (and constant source of <a href="http://youtu.be/WxfZkMm3wcg">creative inspiration</a>), suggesting that it might be a great addition to his travel necessities. But that was before actually experiencing Soylent for myself.</p>

		<blockquote>And my assumption turned out to be a horribly misinformed one.</blockquote>

		<p class = "post">There are two scenarios for drinking Soylent on the go. First, you can premix it at home and bring it with you in a water bottle. Second, you can bring both the powder (and the oil) with you and mix it with water on the go.</p>

		<p class = "post">I wasn&rsquo;t in the office until well after lunch today, so I chose the first. It wasn&rsquo;t a very good decision.</p>

		<p class = "post">The bottle ended up resting in the door pocket of my car, in the heat of a Tennessee July parking lot for about 4 hours. It contained 16oz out of a 20oz capacity. I got back to the car pretty hungry, so I grabbed the bottle and popped the flip-top open with my thumb.</p>

		<blockquote>Thus quickly learning a new equation: heat + Soylent = pressure. </blockquote>

		<p class = "post">And that pressure caused a minor explosion of warm beige batter on my face and the roof of my car. Not a fun lunch.</p>

		<p class = "post">After cleaning up, I drove to the office and put it in the fridge, where it took about an hour to cool to a drinkable temperature.</p>

		<p class = "post">So, method #1 of Soylent on the go was not a pleasant experience. As it turns out, I&rsquo;ll be traveling for a few days next week. We&rsquo;ll see how method #2 works out.</p>

		<blockquote>Hopefully TSA doesnâ€™t have Soylent on the no-fly list.</blockquote>
